# python_coding_challenge



Create a Python function that finds and returns the maximum number among a list of integers.

Modify the function to handle an empty list gracefully and return an appropriate message or value. (Hint: you'll need a new conditional for this)

Find and return both the maximum and minimum numbers in a single function call. (Hint: Python has a built in function called min() that does the opposite of max())
